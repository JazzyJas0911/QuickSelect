# QuickSelect

Part A
 Write a function called Quick_select to find the kth least element on a given array. 
 (The average running time of your algorithm should be O(n)) (Hint: Use partitioning algorithm)
 	1. Request the user to enter a positive integer, and call it n.
 	2. Generate n random integers between -100 to 100 and save them in array a.
 	3. Print the generated array.
 	4. Request the user to enter a number between 1 to n (as the kth least element).
 	5. Call your function to find and print the kth least element.
 Part B
 Explain an algorithm to return the max k numbers from an unsorted array. 
 (The average running time of your algorithm should be O(n)) (Hint: You could modify your Quick_select algorithm to solve this question.)
